## Hello! I'm Rose Hall

I'm a 20y/o software developer​/​engineer based in New York City. For me, designing and building systems is not just a job but a passion. When I'm not building software you can find me spending quality time with friends, exploring the world, and learning to be a hobbyist photographer.

I don't really use GitHub to show off my work. Much of my work I take the most pride in is private and closed source. You can see some of my accomplishments at [https://rose.hall.ly](https://rose.hall.ly) or feel free to send me an email at [rose@hall.ly](mailto:rose@hall.ly)
